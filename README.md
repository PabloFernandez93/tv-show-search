- Practice with making requests via API (using https://hoppscotch.io/ )

- Extracting a search term from the form and saving it to a variable (using console.dir(form) we see the object on the console and there we can check what the name of the key input is. In this case we can see: elements: query: input)
- Using the JavaScript library Axios to make HTTP requests
- Making a query string object with the property of params and passing it in the config object
- Awaiting the query string (in this case we are extracting the image medium data, calling a function makeImages and appending the images to the page.
